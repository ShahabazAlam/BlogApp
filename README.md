# BlogApp

General info
This project is a simple blog app, Where we can post, update, delete blogs. In this project we have role base access control like we can create roles and can give them to update and delete permission.

In the project only super admin have permission to do everything, and a user can create a post, and can delete or update their own post. Create Permissions(Basically we will create only two permissions, Update and Delete), We have Roles We can "Add" and "Update", To each roles we can give permissons to update or delete post. Then we will add a role to the user and according to thal role permissions user can "delete" or "Update" other user's post.
